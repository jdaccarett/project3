Project 3: The Traveling Salesman Problem

Each of us researched a unique algorithm

Algorithm Implemented:

Juan - tps_mst_kruskal.py (find mst using prims for tsp) **implemented
Andrew - Fast algorithm                                  **implemented
Andrew - Hungarian algorithm                             **implemented
Marcus - Kruskals algorithm (not implemented just pseudocode)


INSTRUCTIONS:

To run all of our testcases use program "testfile.py"

this will output running times(secs) and .tour files test-input.txt 1-7 and tsp_example 1-3.
